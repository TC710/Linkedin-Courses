# Linkedin-Courses
My solution for the course challenge 


I am furthur learning by taking course in Linkedin learning.
I am posting my solution.

If there is no solution than it required or edit a file from the course which I will not share if there are codes in them. If it .txt or .pdf I will add them.


Also include other codes that is not related to linkedin in folder titiled only after the programming language used.  


For the Kotlin Essential Training. Due to the large project file it is in .zip format. In the read.me for the course I included how to add kotlinx to intellij.
